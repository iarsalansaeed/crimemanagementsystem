Criminal Management System
Overview
The Criminal Management System is a graphical user interface application developed using the Tkinter library in Python. It provides a platform for managing criminal records, allowing users to input and store information about criminals.


## 1. Git as VCS
I have used git before for out VCS or as SCM. 
It keeps track of changes in project, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your code easily, share your code with fellow and allowing them to contribute with access limitation etc, like fork and PR etc. Its makes the work seamless and more faster. It allows users to manage their codebase efficiently, revert changes if needed, and work on different features concurrently.

## 6.& 7. Build and CI/CD
I have used Jenkins for the build and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). My project is in Python, hence I have used Jenkins with which I am used to working, Python doesn't require build as java programs require for which Maven, Ant etc are used.

## 8. Unit tests

## 9. VS Studio IDE
I love using VS because it's super handy and has lots of cool stuff. It helps me write and test my code, and it's easy to use. Plus, it works great with Git, which is awesome for keeping track of changes in my projects.<br>
